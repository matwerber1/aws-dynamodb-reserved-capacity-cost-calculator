# AWS DynamoDB Reserved Capacity Cost Calculator

This AWS Blog Post [Amazon DynamoDB auto scaling: Performance and cost optimization at any scale](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/amazon-dynamodb-auto-scaling-performance-and-cost-optimization-at-any-scale/) provides guidance on determining how much reserved capacity to buy to optimize cost savings for DynamoDB tables that use provisioned throughput capacity mode. 

The Excel document in this project is my attempt to synthesize the blog post above and (hopefully) make it easy to estimate reserved capacity purchases and cost calculations.
